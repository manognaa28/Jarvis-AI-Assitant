Jarvis AI Assistant

A lightweight enterprise-style AI assistant built using FastAPI, Pinecone vector database, and LLaMA-based embeddings, designed to understand user queries and retrieve contextually relevant information via a chatbot UI.

Problem Statement

Design and build a personal AI assistant (Jarvis) that:

Understands user queries semantically

Stores and retrieves knowledge using a vector database (Pinecone)

Uses a Large Language Model (LLaMA-based) approach

Provides a conversational chatbot interface

Solution Overview

Jarvis uses vector embeddings to represent knowledge and user queries in a semantic space.
Instead of keyword matching, it performs semantic similarity search to retrieve relevant information.

Key Concepts Used

Vector Embeddings
Text is converted into numerical vectors using a LLaMA-based embedding model.

Vector Database (Pinecone)
Stores embeddings and enables fast semantic similarity search.

Semantic Search
User queries are matched with stored knowledge based on meaning, not keywords.

Chatbot UI
Simple conversational interface served directly from the backend.

Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Vector Database: Pinecone (Serverless)

Embeddings: LLaMA-based embedding model (llama-text-embed-v2)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

API Testing: Swagger UI (auto-generated by FastAPI)
