Jarvis is an enterprise AI assistant designed to help organizations retrieve internal knowledge.

Jarvis understands user queries by converting them into vector embeddings using a LLaMA-based model.

The assistant stores knowledge in Pinecone, a vector database optimized for semantic search.

When a user asks a question, Jarvis compares the query embedding with stored document embeddings.

This approach allows Jarvis to return contextually relevant answers instead of keyword-based results.

Jarvis can be integrated into SaaS products as a conversational interface for support and onboarding.

The system architecture supports self-hosted LLaMA models in production environments.
